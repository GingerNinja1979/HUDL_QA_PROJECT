**Improvements and considerations**

- Cross browser testing - Only tested in Chrome
- Performance Testing
- Accessibility Testing
- Duplicated code - eg: self._wait.until and wait_for - In future i would like to avoid using duplicated code
- Social login options & MFA are out of scope for this work
